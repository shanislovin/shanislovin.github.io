			<h1>About the author and her pet.</h1>
			<p class="bodyText"><i>
				Meow, my name is Nori. My pet human is called Shanis. She's amazing. All I have to do to get food is to go up to her, and keep tapping her with my paw. She never tells me to stop and eventually I get my food. I can make her do whatever I want. If I hop into her bed I get a nice scratch behind the ear. When she's working on her laptop, all I have to do is sit on the keys and she gives me attention. She's a good pet. When I'm feeling generous I bring her my dead birds and dead mice, just to let her know I care for her. <br><br>

				My day normally consists of lounging around in the sun. I love a good nap. Then I start my usual afternoon routine. I walk into the lounge room and scratch my favourite couch, to make sure everyone remembers it's mine. Then I'll go for a wander and play with some of my pets. I love it when we play with the toy mouse. They're such good pets, they laugh with me and play until I get bored. That brings me to dinner. I'll jump onto the table and meow until one of my pets finally obeys me and gets my food. <br><br>

				My arch enemy is the red dot. I don't know where it hides. Everyday I look for the red dot but I can't find where it lives. But whenever it comes out I chase it down. I've never been able to kill it. My dream is to bring the red dot to Shanis, and to show her that she's my favourite pet.
